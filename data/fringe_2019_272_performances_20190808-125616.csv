Our summer off has our batteries recharged, our thinking caps and nerd glasses donned, and a series of shows that will leave you feeling informed, inspired, and entertained. We’ve changed our format a bit this season: we’ll do a little pre-show (science demos + trivia) from doors until 8pm, when we’ll start our main show. Be there AND be square! When: Tuesday, September 3, 2019 (doors and pre-show @ 7:30pm | main event @ 8pm)Where: Westbury Theatre, ATB Financial Arts Barns (10330 84 Ave NW)Tickets: $20 in advance (plus fees)No minors. Our line-up of talks includes: The Science of Rock, Paper, ScissorsBen Dyson Rock, Paper, Scissors is an excellent way of resolving deadlock when there are dishes to be done, hedges to be trimmed, taxes to be filed. The game is also interesting from a psychological point-of-view, as it can help us to understand how impulses from our evolutionary past conflict with optimal strategies during competition. I’ll talk about the origins of the game, what research tells us about changes in the quality of decision-making under pressure, and give you a fool-proof way to win every game (not really). Ben Dyson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Alberta. He moved to Edmonton and the U of A in the summer of 2018 from previous positions in Brighton (UK) and Toronto. Working at a University makes you nerdy by osmosis. The blackest sheep: a deep dive into Borderline Personality DisorderSuzanne Cunningham Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is often one of the most stigmatized mental health diagnosis, not just with the general public but also health care professional. What is heck is BPD? How might it manifest? How does it affect the individual? And why is it so stigmatized? These questions and more will be answered to help promote an understanding of how an individual with BPD navigates the world. Interwoven with the educational material, Zanne will also speak candidly about her own lived experience with a diagnosis of BPD. Since discovering a path to wellness, Zanne has become a passionate mental health advocate. Never shying away from opportunities to question conventional thinking about mental illness and sharing her own lived experience, Zanne is part of the systemic change in health care as a Peer Support Worker with Alberta Health Services. After doing a lot of heavy lifting and donating most of her spoons at work, Zanne supports her wellness by engaging her nerd girl. She surrounds herself with graphic novels, watches Star Trek daily, and one day hopes Chewbacca will become her zombie space boyfriend Kick out the jams: how punk changed (and still changes) the worldDylan Richards What is Punk? Is it Mohawks and leather jackets? Three-chord songs and greasy hair? Or is it something more? Punk was (and continues to be) more than just a musical genre; it’s about doing your own thing, making something out of nothing, and in the words of Frank Turner, “not sitting ’round waiting for the light to go green.” Grab your Doc Martins and your favourite old T-shirt, because tonight we’re going to take a look at how Punk music changed—and keeps on changing—the world as we know it. Storyteller, activist, sex educator, and all around nerdiholic, Dylan Richards has brought his passion for helping people discover what makes them shine to classrooms, boardrooms, and gatherings all around the globe. Dylan loves to bring his stories and experience to every topic he tackles, from sexuality to songs to spaghetti (well, cooking in general but then it wouldn’t be as poetic)."|Warnings: Frequent, unapologetic nerdiness. 18+,Duration: 120 minutes|http://i67.tinypic.com/zmlcnl.png|3235|23132

13/08/2019|19:30|Three Ladies - Fringe Theatre Spotlight 2019/20|ATB Financial Arts Barns - Studio Theatre|https://tickets.fringetheatre.ca/listprices.php?performanceId=601:15781|#|#|#|#|In her new play Three Ladies, Edmonton-based dramatist and poet Lady Vanessa Cardona uses monologue, ceremony, poetry, hip-hop and traditional Colombian dance to tell the story of how her life’s most traumatic events — sexual violence and civil war — impacted her sense of identity. More than simply a story of struggle, Three Ladies uses diverse modes of story-telling in combination with unflinching, gritty, vulnerable performance to explore–and ultimately celebrate–her healing journey, and the possibilities of healing that exist in all human beings.

What does a birthday really mean? Every year, every single human being has one, and we each, depending on our ages, cultures, and personalities, relate to it differently. And why is the clown so readily associated with a birthday, invited to help others celebrate? What would happen if this equation were reversed? Creator & performer Michaela Lind hails from Sweden. She has trained at GITIS (Moscow), Mirror Theater (Sweden), Michael Howard Studios and HB studios (NYC), and City University of New York. Past work includes: Edinburgh Fringe, PVD Fringe, Public Theater, LaMaMa, Dixon Place, Ontological Theater, Beijing Children’s Opera, and the streets of the world, and is a proud member of Clowns Ex Machina. www.michaelamlind.com // @aratheater // @misssalomeshead  Director Kendall Cornell is at the helm of the all-women, NYC clown troupe, Clowns Ex Machina. She has created, directed and performed in full-length shows and shorts for LaMaMa, The NY Clown Theatre Festival, the International Festival de Pallasses, Dixon Place, 92nd Street Y, and elsewhere.

Seriously silly, the Money Fish have prepared their world class acrobatic synchro routine for this special presentation. The Money Fish have been swimming through audiences since 2011. They have performed at events such as the Dubai Comedy Festival, Toronto International Buskerfest, and Canada Days at Nathan Phillips Square and Mississauga Celebration Square. Hercinia Arts Collective is a non-profit contemporary circus organization dedicated to creating and performing new contemporary circus works. http://www.herciniarts.com One Man’s Trash… Edmonton, ABWritten & performed by Neil Kuefler, Ben Stevens & Mark Vetsch  Janitors, tasked with cleaning the streets, come across a garbage can filled with discarded props and set pieces from a local theatre. Sifting through the trashed items, they are transformed, each object magically dropping them into a different Shakespearean play. The can will drag these friends through comedy, tragedy, and murder most foul-- proving that with a little imagination, one man's trash is another man's Measure for Measure. Neil, Ben and Mark are all Edmonton-based theatre artists who studied drama & performance at the University of Alberta. They have received physical theatre through many avenues, and learned Pochinko style clown from Mike Kennard and Jan Henderson.
